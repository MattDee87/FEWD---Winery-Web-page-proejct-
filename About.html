    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
        &emsp;The House of Burgundy, Inc. is an independent fine wines & spirits importer and wholesaler based in New York City with a distinguished history.  As are name suggests, we are inspired by Burgundy.  Originally established in 1934 as a premier French and Californian boutique wine wholesaler, we have expanded our portfolio beyond Burgundy over the years. 
 <br>
 <br>
        &emsp;As we approach our 80th year in business, our sensibility remains unchanged.  We select wines with a sense of geography, nurtured by producers who, like us, are passionate and committed to quality.  Today, our hand selected portfolio includes wines from the very best denominations from around the world, including boutique, family owned, small estates, and hidden gems, from France, Argentina, Australia, Bulgaria, Chile, Germany, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, New Zealand, Portugal, Turkey and the United States. 
 <br>
 <br>
        &emsp;We are a unique independent company, privileged to import and sell wines we like.  We constantly seek new wines, fresh perspectives and innovative partnerships. We are fortunate to be part of its history and excited to carry its legacy.  There is no other company like The House of Burgundy, Inc.
 <br>
 <br>
        &emsp;Thank you for your visit.  Contact us anytime for information of any of our wines and services.  We hope to hear from you. 
 <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        &emsp;Only about 15% of Master Sommeliers are women, but as the number of somms in urban restaurants in the US is skyrocketing, thats sure to change.</p>

        <p class = "cotext">&emsp;Italian-born Matthew De Nero, beverage director at Rouge Tomate in New York’s Chelsea district, has created a huge buzz through being the leading sommelier champion of organic, biodynamic and natural wines. 
        <br>

        &emsp;He has two MBAs and had intended to become a professor of philosophy, before turning his academic interests to obtaining the MS certification.</p>

        <br>
