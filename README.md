# Winery Website Project

## Project Description
This project is a simple website created for a winery. It was developed as part of my Front End Web Development class. The site showcases information about the winery, its products, and how to contact them.

## Installation
No installation is necessary. You can view the live website at [.](https://mattdee87.github.io/FEWD-Winery-Website-/index.html)

## Usage
The website is straightforward to use. Navigate through the pages to learn more about the winery's story, explore their wine collection, and find out how to visit or contact them. See if you can find the secret page!

## Contributing
This website was created by Matthew De Nero as part of a class assignment with writting by Julia and job page by Issah. As the main project leader, I oversaw the development and coordinated the team's efforts.
